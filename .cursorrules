# XE Survey Website

Read `.brand/overview.md` for this client's brand identity, personality, and visual language.

## Context Loading (follow these rules — do not skip)

Load the relevant `.brand/` file **before generating** when you encounter these tasks:

- **Any visual implementation** → read the relevant file in `.brand/tokens/` (colors, typography, spacing, motion, surfaces)
- **Working on a specific component** → check `.brand/components/{{name}}.md` if it exists
- **Building a new page or layout** → read `.brand/composition/page-types.md` and check `anti-patterns.md`
- **Writing user-facing copy** → read `.brand/voice.md`
- **Translating a Figma design** → follow `.brand/workflows/figma-to-code.md`
- **Generating code** → follow `.brand/workflows/code-standards.md`
- **Running QA or final checks** → follow `.brand/workflows/qa-checklist.md`

If a referenced file doesn't exist, proceed with your best judgment and flag the gap.

## Rules (enforce always)

1. Every color value must reference a design token. No hex, RGB, or HSL literals in source.
2. Every spacing value must use the spacing scale. No magic numbers.
3. Every border-radius and shadow must use a surface token. No arbitrary values.
4. Use existing design system components. Do not rebuild what exists.
5. Check `.brand/composition/anti-patterns.md` before proposing any layout.
6. Maximum one primary CTA per visible viewport area.
7. Run accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) before considering any page complete.
8. All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.

## Deployment

Push to personal GitHub repo (not the org repo). Deploy via Netlify — see `.brand/workflows/deploy.md`.

## When to Stop and Ask

- A Figma value doesn't map to any known design token
- A component's behavior is ambiguous or underspecified in the design
- A required semantic token doesn't exist in the token system
- You need to make a breaking change to the token system or component API
- The design conflicts with an anti-pattern rule
